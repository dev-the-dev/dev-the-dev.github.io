# Devon Gilbert

Hi, I'm Devon, a software developer based in the United States.  
This site is a simple personal landing page for my projects and tools.

## About This Site

This is a personal site that I use to host small utilities, experiments, and documentation for things I build in my free time.  
It is not a commercial business and I do not sell any products or services here.

## Family Football Pool

Each NFL season I run a private football pickem pool for a small group of family and close friends.  
Participants submit their weekly picks through a Google Form that I host.  
I use a toll free phone number and Twilio to send occasional SMS reminders so people remember to fill out their picks on time.

Messages are sent only to people I know personally who have shared their number with me and agreed to receive these reminders.  
Anyone can opt out of reminders at any time by contacting me directly or replying to a message asking to stop.

## Contact

If you need to reach me about anything related to this site or my projects, you can contact me at the email address listed on my GitHub profile.
